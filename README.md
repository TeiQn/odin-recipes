The aim of this exercise is to demonstrate all the basic knowledge about html
that was taught in the curriculum. This will be an ongoing project and I am
hoping that by the time I manage to complete the course, it would be a good
looking webpage that I could be proud of, in the mean time, it will be as simple
as it can be.
