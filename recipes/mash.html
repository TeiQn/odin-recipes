    <img src="../img/mash.jpg">
    <p>Fluffy and gooey with cheese, while it takes a while to prepare, it is a very simple yet very filling dish! Eat it with meat and gravy and you'll be all set!</p>
    <p>You can boil the potatoes conventionally, or if you happen to have a rice cooker, it could also work! Now here're what you're gonna need for the recipe for two!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>5 Potatoes</li>
                <li>1/2 Cup of Milk</li>
                <li>1 to 2 tbsp Salt(to taste)</li>
                <li>125g Butter</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp Pepper</li>
                <li>How ever much cheese you want</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start boiling enough water in a pot to cover all of your potatoes. If you are going to use a rice cooker, ignore this step.</li>
                    <li>Clean and peel the potatoes, and kiss them a little; it makes them yummier.</li>
                    <li>If you are cooking them with a rice cooker, put all the potatoes in the rice cooker and put enough water for the potatoes to be under water with an inch of extra water.</li>
                    <li>When the water starts boiling, lower the heat, put the potatoes in the pot and cover it with a lid. The time it takes for them to become soft varies, so make sure to check by stabbing them gently with any utensil available to you.</li>
                    <li>Strain the potatoes when they are soft enough to mash.</li>
                    <li>If you boiled them enough, mashing them should be easy, mash the potatoes with a fork.</li>
                    <li>Add 125g of butter while you mash, it's important to add the butter while the mash is hot to melt it.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 to 2 tbsp of salt, 1/2 tbsp of pepper, and mix until satisfied.</li>
                    <li>Add as much cheese as you please.</li>
                    <li>Pour 1/2 cup of milk and mash it to make the potato absorb the milk.</li>
                </ol>
